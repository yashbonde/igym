### Why?

There are a tonne of good ideas and philosophy of what intelligence exactly is, some of the things:
* [Machine Learning Street Talk - Francois Chollet - On the Measure Of Intelligence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEVnu-KZjq4)
* [ARC Challenge](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.01547.pdf)
* [Intelligence Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence)
* [AGI Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence)

and on ... and on ... and on. However only a few people write about the use the AI as a **tool** and when they do mention it, it is usually as the assumption and focus is on generalisation or solving a specific problem / benchmark.

> I am arguing that form follows function and thus the building blocks of AGI should be based on function.

This project aims to test the ability of language models to travel the internet and answer questions. If it can travel the internet, then it can answer questions far better than any human individual can based on the amount of cached information on Google.
